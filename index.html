            Today we were having an activity where we are tasked to create a responsive webpage using HTML and CSS. The goal is to make it look good on both desktop and mobile devices.
            <br>
            <br>
            We are using a simple layout with a header, two side asides, and a main content area. The header will contain the title of the page.
            <br>
            <br>
            Welp, our instructor wanted us to write down something inside th emain content and said that maybe we could write some sort of diary.

            Turns out, it wasn't really that difficult to create what was asked for. I did have a few head aches here and ther but they were all handled with quite ok.
